# Background
My career has been in roles with titles like "Customer Support Specialist" or "Technical Specialist", but I've always had the goal of doing front end engineering. I'm someone who enjoys tinkering with new tools, and learning new things as needed for specific projects. Over the years I've started various tutorials/guides to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, only to abandon them when I'd struggle to understand something. Sometimes I felt like I would never be able to learn the advanced (but necessary) concepts to become a proper programmer, or that it would be more rational to comfortably progress up the career ladder in a technical Customer Success job.

Since picking up this endevor again in February 2023, I have committed to pushing through the discomfort of not understanding concepts, of needing to read a few different explinations.

I am going through [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) JavaScript path, because I appreciate its use of varied documentation sources, videos, and projects.

## What's this repository for?
I am going to keep track of learnings, objectives, and store miscellaneous projects.

## How it is going
It feels like I am about here in my journey:
