## What's confusing today
- Functions with functions in their parameters

## Topics to confirm knowledge of
- Geters and Setters

## A Glossary of my own
class: a blueprint
object: the house, with actual properties

this: when you have objects, various parts of code that repeat, you need a way for the object to refer to refer to itself. imagine a dozens robots, and you say lift arm. whose arm? the arm of robot doing the command, this one.

closure: a function within another function, and the inner function has access to the scope in the outer function

Arrow functions: good for callbacks and anonymous functions

### prototypal inheritance
## my definintion
everything has a classification. text is called "strings", numbers are numbers, true/false is boolean. folders of information or code are called Objects. when you have multiple objects, let's say apples in an encylclopedia of food, each apple you configure will have the same properies: color, taste, name—and each new apple inherates a set of properties, it's like you're filling out a form rather than writing down information on a blank piece of paper. and the form for new apple is actually the same as a new fruit, which is basically the same as the form for all other foods, and the form for new foods, is actually an object. it all comes back to "what is this code"
(what are the limitations)

## from odin project
the prototype is another object that the original object inherits from, which is to say, the original object has access to all of its prototype’s methods and properties.

event bubbling and delegation: not sure how to describe this.
