## What's confusing today
- Object constructors
- Factory functions

## A Glossary of my own
this: when you have objects, various parts of code that repeat, you need a way for the object to refer to refer to itself. imagine a dozens robots, and you say lift arm. whose arm? the arm of robot doing the command, this one.

closure: a function that has access to variables in its 

prototypal inheritance: everything has a classification. text is called "strings", numbers are numbers, true/false is boolean. folders of information or code are called Objects. when you have multiple objects, let's say apples in an encylclopedia of food, each apple you configure will have the same properies: color, taste, nameâ€”and each new apple inherates a set of properties, it's like you're filling out a form rather than writing down information on a blank piece of paper. and the form for new apple is actually the same as a new fruit, which is basically the same as the form for all other foods, and the form for new foods, is actually an object. it all comes back to "what is this code"
(what are the limitations)

event bubbling and delegation: not sure how to describe this.
